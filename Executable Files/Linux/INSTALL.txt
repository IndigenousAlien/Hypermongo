INSTALL:
- Install the Hypermongo git repository as a zip file at https://github.com/IndigenousAlien/Hypermongo
- Open the terminal on your Linux OS and make sure you have unzip installed by typing either "sudo apt install unzip" or "sudo yum install unzip", depending if your
  OS uses Debian or Fedora.
- cd to your downloads folder by inputting "cd ~/downloads" and check to see if Hypermongo.zip is in the directory with the "ls" command.
- unzip the file using the command "unzip Hypermongo.zip" which will create a new directory "Hypermongo", which you can choose to move elsewhere using the command
  "mv ~/downloads/Hypermongo/ (newdirectory path here)"
- cd into the Hypermongo directory and ls to see if the Executable files folder is there. cd into "Executable Files" and then cd into "Linux".
- type ls to check if the HypermongoLinux.exe file is there. Lastly, copy the file and move it into your bin folder by typing "cp HypermongoLinux.exe ~/bin"
- check to see if the executable file works by typing "HypermongoLinux.exe" into the command prompt. The exe file can be run anywhere by simply typing the same 
  command into the terminal. If you wish, you can rename the "HypermongoLinux.exe" into something shorter like "hmx.exe" to make typing the command easier.
  
OPTIONAL:
- You can also make an alias to run the file in the command terminal by typing "gedit ~/.bashrc" (or instead of gedit, any text editing software, i.e vim, etc --
  if you don't have these install them using "sudo apt install gedit")
- scroll to the bottom of your .bashrc file and make a new line and type "#User aliases". Make another line and type "alias (name you want)='~/bin/HypermongoLinux.exe'
  then save the file and close it. NOTE: if you renamed your HypermongoLinux.exe file, put that name in for the alias line after ~/bin/  instead.
- Then you need to update the .bashrc list by typing in into the terminal, ". ~/.bashrc". Now you should be able to run the file by typing the alias name! 
  Ex. if my alias's name is hmx, then I just type "hmx" into the terminal.
