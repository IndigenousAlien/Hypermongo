INSTALL:
Note - This version of Hypermongo is intended for OS running Windows. You will also need about 1 GB of space on your local disk.

Unfortunately, the file for the HypermongoSetup.exe is too large for GitHub to accept, and I'm not going to be upgrading my account anytime soon. If you'd like a copy of the file, you can email me at jtran9148@gmail.com, or you can email jalombar@allegheny.edu.
